# Investigating-Fandigo-Movie-Review
In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest 

our goal is to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. The population of interest for our analysis is made of all the movie ratings stored on Fandango's website.

The data we are working is sampled, one sample was to the previous to Analysis and other was after the analysis.

From Hickey's analysis article we can see the crietria for sampling,
1. The movie must have had at least 30 fan ratings on Fandango's website at the time of sampling 
2. The movie must have had tickets on sale in 2015.

From the sampling crietria we can say that sampling was not on random basis because only movie with atleast 30 fan ratings were considered.

The sampling conditions for movie ratings 2016-2017 ,
1. The movie must have been released in 2016 or later.
2. The movie must have had a considerable number of votes and reviews.
